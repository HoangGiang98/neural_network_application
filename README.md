# Neural-Network-Application
A prototype of web-based application that facilitates machine learning development on both web client and server platforms by using the TensorFlow.js framework. 
<br />

This is a part of my bachelor thesis at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Inovex Gmbh, where one of the requirement is to build an prototype of a web application that can distribute ANNs models on both web browser and server platforms in four different scenarios.
<br />

With the help of TensorFlow.js, we will implement a web application system that supports sending artificial neural networks (ANNs) models from a client to a server and vice versa. Furthermore, the system would also allow dif- ferent processes of a machine learning pipeline, such as training or evaluating a model, to run interchangeably in these different environments.
